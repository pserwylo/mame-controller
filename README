Mame Controller

In a similar vein to other remote control apps for Android/iOS, this will provide a remote control interface for controlling a PC.
The difference is that the UI will specifically be targeted towards playing MAME arcade games.

The clients will run on the phone, and talk to a server which is written in python and running on the machine that MAME is running on.
The input from the client will be converted to input that the MAME can understand (probably just keyboard keys).
